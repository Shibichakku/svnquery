    <p>
        SvnQuery is a fast full text search engine for subversion repositories. 
		It searches every file in every revision. Not only the content of a file 
		is indexed, but also its complete metadata like path, author, comments 
		and properties. A simple, Google-like web frontend is provided, but it 
		is hoped that the query library and indexing mechanism can be reused in 
		other frontends, e.g. a web service or a Visual Studio Plug-In.</p>
    <p>
        SvnQuery is implemented in C# 3.0 and ASP.NET is used for the web 
		frontend. The full text search is done by Lucene.Net which delivers an 
		astonishing search speed.</p>
    <p>
        The interface to subversion is isolated so that the svn command 
		line client or something like SharpSvn can be used as an implementation. 
		Porting to Java using the original implementation of Lucene should be 
		easy.

    <h3>
        Download Demo</h3>
	<p>Download a self running demo of SvnWebQuery with an already created 
	index. As a prerequisite you need the
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6">
	.Net Framework 3.5</a>. Start SvnQueryDemo.exe to open the web ui for 
	querying the index. If you want to recreate or update the index look into 
	index_create.cmd and index_update.cmd. Note that because of their size the 
	downloads are hosted on atombrenner.de.

	<h3>
        Roadmap</h3>
	<p>
        The current version 0.5 is feature complete, well tested and working in 
		a real life environment. For version 1.0 the following features are 
		planned</p>
    <ol>
    <li>compatible with Subversion 1.6</li>
	<li>Syntax highlighting for common languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Xml) </li>
    <li>Highlighting of hits</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This projects needs more advertisement because only very few people seem 
	to use it. Which made me a little bit sad, because the benefits of using a 
	super fast search engine are much greater than I originally expected. I 
	cannot imagine using a vcs without a sophisticated search any more, and if 
	you need to scan your repository often for common anti patterns, misused 
	patterns or garbage commits, this tool is worth gold. </p>
