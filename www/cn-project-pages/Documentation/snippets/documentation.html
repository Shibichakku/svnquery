It can do a full text search for content and certain metadata like filename, path, author and so on.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>SvnQuery maintains a full text index (powered by <span lang="de">L</span>ucene) of the repository which is used for fast querying. This index needs to be created once for an existing repository. When the repository changes the index needs to be updated. If you have access to the repository server you can use a post-commit hook to have your index always up to date. Indexing is done in a real detached background process, so users don't notice any delay when committing to the repository. </p><p>Alternatively you can choose to do scheduled updates, e.g. once a day. This is useful f you want to index a remote subversion server where you cannot use hooks. On Windows you can use <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569">Scheduled Tasks</a> to do this</p><p>SvnQuery's frontend is an ASP.NET web application similar to a typical web search engine. You enter a query and milliseconds later you see your hits. You can not only search the head revision but also all revisions at once or an arbitrary custom revision range. There is one core library, SvnQuery.dll, which implements a simple but powerful query language especially suited to query code repositories. Hopefully other application, tools or addins will make use of this library. </p><h3>Detailed Documentation</h3><p>SvnQuery currently consists of three parts</p><ol><li>SvnIndex, a command line tool for creating and updating the full text index </li><li>SvnWebQuery, an ASP.NET web application for querying the index </li><li>SvnQuery.dll, a programmers library which can be used to query the index </li></ol><h4>SvnIndex - Maintaining the repository index</h4><p>The command line tool SvnIndex maintains the full text index of a subversion repository. It has two subcommands for creating and updating an index. </p><p><code>svnindex create <indexfolder /><repositoryurl />[Options]</code></p><p>Creates a new index at <code>IndexFolder</code> for the repository located at <code>RepositoryUrl</code>. Any existing content at <code>IndexFolder</code> will be overwritten. The optional <code>Revision</code> parameter specifies up to which revision the index will be created. If <code>Revision</code> is omitted the head revision will be used. Depending on the size of your repository indexing could take quite a long time (probably hours). It is a good idea to initially index only a few revisions and check if the basic mechanisms work. Then update the index later.</p><p><code>svnindex update <indexfolder /><repositoryurl />[Options]</code></p><p>Updates an existing index at <code>IndexFolder</code> for the repository located at <code>RepositoryUrl</code>. The optional <code>Revision</code> parameter specifies the youngest revision to be included in the index. If <code>Revision</code> is omitted the head revision will be used. <code>Revision</code> needs to be greater than the index revision and smaller or equal to the repositories head revision. </p><h4>SVN WebQuery</h4><ul><li>create virtual directory</li><li>open web page, enter query, press search or enter</li><li>detailed help is available on the associated help page</li></ul><h4>SvnQuery Code Library</h4><ul><li>get the source</li><li>look into the tests and the SVN Query implementation </li></ul>
