<h3>Summary </h3><p>SvnQuery helps you finding files in your subversion repository like Google helps you finding pages on the internet. It 
does a full text search for content and metadata like filename, path, author and 
arbitrary svn properties.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>SvnQuery maintains a full text index (powered by <span lang="de">L</span>ucene) of the repository which is used for fast querying. This index needs to be created once for an existing repository. When the repository changes the index needs to be updated. 
This is usually triggered by a simple post-commit hook. Indexing is done in a detached background process, so users don't notice any delay when committing to the repository. </p><p>Alternatively, 
if you have no access to the repository, you can choose to do scheduled updates, e.g. once a day. This is useful 
if you want to index a remote subversion repository where you cannot use hooks. On Windows you can use <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569">Scheduled Tasks</a> to do this</p><p>SvnQuery's frontend is an ASP.NET web application similar to a typical web search engine. You enter a query and milliseconds later you see your hits. You can not only search the head revision but also all revisions at once or an arbitrary custom revision range. There is one core library, SvnQuery.dll, which implements a simple but powerful query language especially suited to query code repositories. Hopefully other application, tools or addins will make use of this library. </p><h3>Detailed Documentation</h3><p>SvnQuery currently consists of three parts</p><ol><li>

<a name="SvnIndex">SvnIndex</a> - Maintaining the repository index</h4><p>The command line tool SvnIndex maintains the full text index of a subversion repository. It has two subcommands for creating and updating an index. </p><p><code>svnindex create 
&lt;Index&gt; &lt;Repository&gt; [Options]</code></p><p>Creates a new index at <code>Index</code> for the repository located at <code>Repository</code>. Any existing content at <code>Index</code> will be overwritten.&nbsp; The
<code>-r </code>option (filter) specifies up to which revision the index will be created. If <code>
-r</code> is omitted the head revision will be used. Depending on the size of your repository indexing could take quite a long time. It is a good idea to initially index only a few revisions and check if the basic mechanisms work. Then update the index later 
to the head revision. With the -f option (filter) you can exclude items matching 
the given regular expression from being indexed. E.g. you might want to exclude 
tje &quot;tags&quot; folder to prevent an excessively big index. As tags are by convention 
only copies of the trunk or branches you don&#39;t loose much information. </p><p><code>svnindex update 
&lt;Index&gt; &lt;Repository&gt; [Options]</code></p><p>Updates an existing index at <code>Index</code> for the repository located at <code>Repository</code>. The 
<code>-r</code> option specifies the youngest revision to be included in the index. If <code>
-r</code> is omitted the head revision will be used.&nbsp; </p>
<p><code>Index</code> is always a path to a folder in the local filesystem. <code>Repository</code> is 
either a path to a repository in the local filesystem or a valid url of a 
repository accessed by the svn: or http: protocol. </p>
<h5>All options</h5>
<p>
<code>-r</code> max revision to be included in the index<br>
<code>-u</code> User (if using the svn: or http: protocol)<br>
<code>-p</code> Password<br>
<code>-f</code> regex filter for items that should be ignored, e.g. &quot;.*/tags/.*&quot;<br>
<code>-t</code> max number of threads used to query the repository in parallel<br>
<code>-c</code> commit interval (number of revisions that are written to the index in a transaction)<br>
<code>-o</code> optimize interval (number of&nbsp; revisions between index optimization) <br>
<code>-n</code> name of the index (for display in clients e.g. SvnWebQuery)<br>
<code>-x</code> external visible repository uri (for downloadable result sets) <br>
<code>-v</code> log verbosity level (0..3, 0 is lowest, 1 is default)
