
How to build SVN Query
======================


Prerequisites:
--------------

 - .NET Framework 3.5 
 - Optional: Visual Studio 2008 or better (for manual build)

The build mechanism is as self contained as possible. 
3rdParty things are are directly used from the "3rdParty" folder, 
no additional installations are necessary. 

To build a local SVN Query release just doubleclick make.cmd 
or call it from the command prompt. After building and testing
the binaries can be found in the build/builds/ folder 


Details:
--------

SVNQuery MSBuild from the .NET framework for automatic builds and 
tests. All build related stuff lives in the folder "build". The
build project "build.proj" defines the following targets:

Clean    : Deletes all intermediate output folders
Build    : Builds all projects
Rebuild  : Clean, then Build
RunTests : Build, then run all NUnit tests
Publish  : Rebuild, RunTests, copy output below the builds folder

You can build from a command line like this (msbuild in path) 

msbuild /t:<target>  [/p:Configuration=Release|Debug]

Example: msbuild /t:make 

or you can use one of the convenient cmd files:

run_tests.cmd : just build and run all unit tests
make.cmd      : Rebuild, RunTests and Publish (Release only)
