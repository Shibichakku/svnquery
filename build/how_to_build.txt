
How to build SVN Query
======================


Prerequisites:
--------------

 - .NET Framework 3.5 
 - Visual Studio 2010 or better (for manual build)

The build mechanism is as self contained as possible. 
3rdParty things are are directly used from the "3rdParty" folder, 
no additional installations are necessary. 

To build a local SVN Query release just run "MSBuild /tv:3.5" from the
VS Command Prompt, which will call the default DoRelease target.
After building and testing the binaries can be found in the build folder.


Details:
--------

SVNQuery uses MSBuild from the .NET framework for automatic builds and 
tests. All build related stuff lives in the folder "build". The
build project "build.proj" defines the following targets:

Clean    : Deletes all intermediate output folders
Build    : Builds all projects
Rebuild  : Clean, then Build
RunTests : Build, then run all NUnit tests
Publish  : Build, then copy output below the builds folder
DoRelease: Rebuild, RunTests, copy output below the builds folder

You can build from a command line like this (msbuild in path) 

msbuild /tv:3.5 /t:<target> [/p:Configuration=Release|Debug]
