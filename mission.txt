
Mission:

Enable fast full text search in subversion repositories. 
Search should be possible for file content, path name, 
svn-properties, author and comments. Every revision will
be searched not only the head or current revision. 

The subversion Search Service is intended to be used 
from different front ends, e.g. a simple google like web 
interface or a Visual Studio plugin. For the web frontend
we can use WebSVN to display the content of the found
documents, perhaps with some slight modifications to 
highlight found terms.

The implementation will be done in C# using Lucene.NET 
as a full text search engine. The interface to subersion
will be isolated so that the svn command line client
or something like SharpSvn can be used. Porting to Java
using the Java implementation of Lucene should be easy.
